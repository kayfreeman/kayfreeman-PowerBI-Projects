# Power BI Projects Portfolio

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my journey which i have curated from 2018 till date. It showcases all that i have done over the years using using Microsoft Power BI to design, develop, and deploy interactive dashboards, analytical models, and data-driven reports across diverse domains and use cases. Each project within this folder represents a unique business scenario—ranging from operational intelligence and financial analysis to market insights and public sector performance monitoring.

The core objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my capabilities in transforming raw, unstructured, and structured data into actionable visual narratives. Every project leverages what i have learnt from countless videos on YouTube and Udemy as well as hours of unfinished classes of paid and free classes. I strongly believe practice makes perfect in the world of data modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and UI/UX design to ensure clarity, performance, and value for decision-makers.

In this collection are:
- End-to-end Power BI solutions
- Clean data models optimized for performance
- Rich visualizations that tell compelling stories
- Practical applications of business intelligence concepts
- Documentation for context and reproducibility

Each subfolder contains:
- `.pbix` files (Power BI Desktop projects)
- Sample datasets or data connectors (where applicable)
- Project-specific documentation
- Screenshots and insights summary

This repository is a living body of work and will be updated continuously as new domains and business challenges are explored through Power BI.
